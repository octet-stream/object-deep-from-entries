## API

`objectDeepFromEntries(entries) -> {object | object[] | any[]}`

  * **{Array<[string | number | Array<string | number>, any]>}** â€“ An array of
    tuples with paths and values. Path might be a **string**,
    **number** or an **array** of those to types. Value may have any type.

### Usage

```js
import objectDeepFromEntries from "object-deep-from-entries"

// You can create a flat object using entries in the same format
const flat = [
  [
    "name", "John Doe"
  ],
  [
    "age", 25
  ],
  [
    "gender", "Male"
  ]
]

objectDeepFromEntries(flat)
// -> {name: "John Doe", age: 25, gender: "Male"}

// This function is also useful for making "deep" objects. Let's take a look:
const deep = [
  [
    "name", "John Doe"
  ],
  [
    ["skills", 0], "Node.js"
  ],
  [
    ["skills", 1], "JavaScript"
  ],
  [
    ["skills", 2], "Preact"
  ]
]

objectDeepFromEntries(deep)
// -> {name: "John Doe", skills: [Node.js, "JavaScript", "Preact"]}
```
